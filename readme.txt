HC-SR04 Sensor Functionality Check

Description:
This Arduino sketch checks the functionality of an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor and displays its status in the Serial Monitor. The sketch measures the distance to an object using the sensor and compares it to predefined valid distance ranges. The sensor's status is then indicated as "good" or "not functioning properly."

Components Needed:
- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor
- Jumper wires

Circuit Setup:
1. Connect the HC-SR04's trigPin to digital pin 2 and the echoPin to digital pin 3.
2. Configure connections as required.

Uploading the Sketch:
1. Open the Arduino IDE and create a new sketch.
2. Copy and paste the provided code into the sketch.
3. Connect the Arduino board to your computer via USB.
4. Select the correct board and port from the "Tools" menu in the IDE.
5. Click the "Upload" button to upload the code to the Arduino board.

Usage:
1. After uploading the code, the Arduino will check the HC-SR04 sensor's functionality by measuring distances.
2. Open the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE (Tools -> Serial Monitor) to view distance measurements and the sensor's status.

Status Indicators:
- If the measured distance falls within the valid range, the sensor is considered "good."
- If the measured distance is outside the valid range, the sensor is labeled as "not functioning properly."

Customization:
- Adjust the valid distance range (minValidDistance, maxValidDistance) to match your sensor's specifications.
- Modify the code to include additional features or functionalities.

Acknowledgments:
This Arduino project is a simple and useful way to verify the HC-SR04 sensor's functionality. Experiment and learn from the results!
